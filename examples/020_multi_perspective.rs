//! Example 020: Multi-Perspective Evaluation
//!
//! This example demonstrates the multi-perspective evaluation strategy where
//! the agent evaluates its work from multiple different viewpoints with
//! weighted scoring to determine if it should continue working.
//!
//! The multi-perspective strategy enables:
//! - Multiple evaluation criteria with different weights
//! - Balanced assessment from various stakeholder perspectives
//! - Weighted scoring system for comprehensive evaluation
//! - Holistic view of work quality and completeness
//! - Balanced decision-making considering multiple viewpoints
