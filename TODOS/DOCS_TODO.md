# DOCS_TODO.md - Documentation Implementation Guide

## üìã Documentation Philosophy & Approach

**CORE PRINCIPLES:**
- üìö **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with "How to Use" ‚Üí progress to "How it Works" ‚Üí finally "How to Extend"
- üéØ **Multi-Audience Support**: Serve both library users and developers with distinct pathways
- ‚úÖ **Unified Documentation**: In-source rustdoc comments + GitHub markdown docs in single pass
- üîÑ **Continuous Validation**: Every commit triggers doc review, full reviews before releases
- üìè **Cognitive Load Management**: Consistent structure reduces mental overhead
- ‚úçÔ∏è **User-Focused Writing**: Documentation that speaks directly to users' needs and goals

**Documentation Workflow Modes:**
1. **FULL_REVIEW**: Complete documentation audit (initial setup & pre-release)
2. **INCREMENTAL_UPDATE**: Post-commit targeted updates (daily development)

**IMPORTANT: Files to Ignore**
- Do NOT document files ending in `_TODO.md` - these are implementation guides for development workflow
- Focus only on source code, tests, examples, and creating GitHub markdown documentation

## ‚úçÔ∏è Documentation Writing Style Guidelines

### Voice and Tone
- **User-obsessed**: Frame benefits from the user's perspective ("You'll be able to..." rather than "The library provides...")
- **Confident but not boastful**: State features and benefits matter-of-factly
- **Conversational yet professional**: Use accessible language without being overly casual
- **Action-oriented**: Emphasize what users can do or achieve
- **Trustworthy**: Provide clear, straightforward communication without marketing fluff

### Writing Principles
- **Clarity above all**: Choose simple words over complex ones, use short sentences when possible
- **Scannable format**: Use bullet points for features, bold text for key information
- **Front-loaded benefits**: Place the most important information first
- **Specific over vague**: "Processes 10,000 records per second" not "high performance"
- **Active voice**: "Parse the configuration" not "The configuration can be parsed"

### GitHub Markdown Formatting Guidelines
- **Standard markdown emphasis**: Use `**text**` for bold, `*text*` for italic
- **Consistent formatting**: Maintain standard GitHub markdown format across all docs
- **Cross-reference format**: Use `[page title](page.md)` for internal doc links
- **Source code links**: Use `üìö [Link Description](../src/module/mod.rs)` to link docs to source files
- **GitHub relative links**: Use relative paths for linking to other files in the repository

### Common Phrases and Patterns
- "Developers who use this often combine it with..."
- "Commonly used together with..."
- Start sentences with action verbs: "Create," "Build," "Transform," "Parse"
- Use "you" and "your" frequently to personalize the experience
- "This enables you to..." rather than "This feature allows..."

### Structural Elements
- Concise headlines that include key attributes or benefits
- Feature bullets that start with capital letters but don't end with periods
- Clear hierarchy of information (most to least important)
- Consistent formatting across all documentation
- Code examples immediately after concepts

### What to Avoid
- Exclamation points (!)
- Superlatives and hyperbole ("amazing," "incredible," "best ever")
- Industry jargon without explanation
- Long paragraphs in API descriptions
- Passive voice constructions
- Marketing language or sales pitch tone
- Assumptions about user's knowledge level without context

## üìù Documentation Templates

### Module Documentation Template:
```rust
//! Parse and validate CloudFormation templates with type safety.
//!
//! This module enables you to work with CloudFormation templates while maintaining
//! Rust's type safety guarantees. You'll get compile-time validation of resource
//! types and runtime validation of template structure.
//!
//! # Get Started
//!
//! Parse your first template:
//! ```
//! use crate::parser::Template;
//!
//! let template = Template::from_yaml(yaml_string)?;
//! let resources = template.resources();
//! ```
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The parser uses a two-phase approach: structural validation followed by
//! semantic analysis. See [parser architecture](../docs/architecture.md#parser)
//! for implementation details.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! - Parses templates up to 1MB in under 100ms
//! - Memory usage scales linearly with template size
//! - Zero-copy parsing where possible
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! - `validation`: Enable full semantic validation (default: on)
//! - `async`: Add async parsing support for large templates
```

### Test Documentation Template:
```rust
/// Verifies that nested resource references resolve correctly across template sections.
///
/// This test ensures the reference resolver can handle complex scenarios where
/// resources reference other resources through multiple levels of indirection.
/// This matters because CloudFormation templates often have deep reference chains
/// that must resolve correctly for deployment to succeed.
///
/// Specific cases tested:
/// - Direct references using !Ref
/// - Attribute access via !GetAtt through 3 levels
/// - Circular reference detection
#[test]
fn resolves_nested_resource_references() {
    // Test implementation
}
```

### Function Documentation Template:
```rust
/// Parse a CloudFormation template from YAML format.
///
/// This function takes your YAML string and returns a fully validated template
/// structure. You'll get detailed error messages for any validation failures,
/// including line numbers and suggestions for fixes.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `yaml` - Your CloudFormation template as a YAML string
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A validated `Template` ready for processing, or an error describing
/// what went wrong and how to fix it.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Parse a simple template:
/// ```
/// use crate::parse_yaml;
///
/// let template = parse_yaml(r#"
///     Resources:
///       MyBucket:
///         Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
/// "#)?;
/// 
/// assert_eq!(template.resources().count(), 1);
/// ```
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `ParseError` when:
/// - YAML syntax is invalid - check for indentation issues
/// - Required fields are missing - ensure Resources section exists
/// - Resource types are unknown - verify AWS resource type names
```

### Example Documentation Template:
```rust
//! # Build a Multi-Stack CloudFormation Template
//!
//! This example shows you how to create a template that deploys a web application
//! with proper separation of concerns across multiple stacks.
//!
//! ## What You'll Learn
//!
//! - Create reusable template components
//! - Share values between stacks using exports
//! - Validate cross-stack references
//!
//! ## Running This Example
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --example multi_stack_template
//! ```
//!
//! You'll see output showing the generated template structure and validation results.
//!
//! ## Code Walkthrough
//!
//! First, you'll create the network stack that other stacks will reference...

// Define your network stack with exportable VPC ID
let network_stack = StackBuilder::new("NetworkStack")
    .add_vpc("MyVPC")  // This creates an exportable VPC
    .build();

// Next, create an application stack that references the network...
```
